Scizor is a red, metal, ant-like Pok√©mon with yellow and black patterns on its pincers which resemble an eye pattern. Its body consists of three main parts: the torso, the abdomen and the head. It stands on two legs and has a pair of small wings located on its back which are used to control its body temperature, rather than flying. Scizor's habitat is lush and vast where it can reside with the rest of the swarm.
