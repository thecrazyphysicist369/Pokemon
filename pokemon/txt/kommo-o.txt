There is a legend that says Kommo-o is covered in glittering scales in order to drive away a great darkness covering the world. The reason these Pokémon seek out battle is to gain the power needed to defeat this darkness. When it detects someone approaching, Kommo-o rings the scales on its tail to announce its presence. It has no desire to battle against weak Pokémon.
