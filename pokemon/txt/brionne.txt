Brionne learns its dances by imitating the other members of its colony. It sometimes even learns dances from humans. This Pok√©mon is a hard worker and pours itself into its efforts until it has memorized each dance. As it dances, Brionne creates balloon after balloon. In battle, it first sends its opponent into disarray with its dancing, and then slaps its balloons into its target, causing the balloons to explode and deal damage.
